# iOS On-Device Transcription & Translation Demo

![Banner](./screenshot.jpg)

## ðŸŽ¯ Overview

This project demonstrates an on-device Proof of Concept (POC) for **transcribing** audio files and **translating** the results into multiple languages using Appleâ€™s native `Speech` and `Translation` frameworks. No external APIs are used, ensuring privacy and offline compatibility.

The UI is built using **SwiftUI**, and the app supports importing `.mp3` files, live transcription, language switching, and exporting transcripts.
